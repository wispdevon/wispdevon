# Question and Answers
- The chatbot should provide answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs).
- Create a knowledge base(s) that includes a link to an external website (e.g. your company website) and at least one PDF containing additional FAQ information.
- The chatbot should also be able to handle general small talk, e.g. “Are you a bot or a human?”, “How are you?”, etc.
- The chatbot should not engage in out-of-scope questions to avoid users unnecessarily playing with the chatbot as if it is ChatGPT, e.g. “What do you think about Pluto not being a planet?”

## Human Hand-off
- Add an intent for user questions related to a human being available to take over the conversation and answer the user with a standard message saying no humans are available.

## Collect and Store User Information
- The chatbot should ask and remember the users’ names, email addresses, and phone numbers.
- Make use of the tables and save the contact details provided by the users.

## Create Support Tickets
- The chatbot must be able to create a support ticket on a user’s behalf. This process should involve at least these four steps:
  1. Collect the user's issue or question.
  2. Collect the business type using a single-choice card (Personal, Startup, Enterprise, etc.)
  3. Determine the urgency of the request based on the business type (The bigger the business, the more urgent the request).
  4. Collect any additional information needed (according to your business, e.g. product type).

## Send Confirmation Emails
- After a support ticket has been created, the chatbot should send an email to the user's provided email address. The email should include:
  1. A transcript of the chat conversation.
  2. The relevant ticket details
  3. A randomly generated ticket number.
- You can use a service like SendGrid’s API to send the email.

## User Feedback
- The chatbot should ask the user for their feedback on their experience using the chatbot.

## Optimal User Experience
- The chatbot should handle user inputs gracefully, including cases where users provide incomplete or incorrect information.
- Ensure that the user experience is intuitive and user-friendly throughout the conversation.
- Prompt inactive users where needed.

## Multi-lingual
- The chatbot should be able to assist the user in any language.

## Channels
- The chatbot should be available via Webchat and Telegram.
- Create a demo web page and embed the chatbot on the page.
- Adjust the style to fit your branding. (You can use the Webchat Styler or CSS).
