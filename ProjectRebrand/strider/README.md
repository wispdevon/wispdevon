# Strider

A collaborative Kanban workspace for planning work and remembering what you finish.
Move tasks through Plan, Active, and Review, assign people and subtasks, and
revisit completed work in the Hall of Fame.

A [Devon Labs](https://devonlabs.space) project by [Wisp](https://github.com/wispdevon).

[Run locally](#getting-started) · [Deployment guide](DEPLOY.md) · [Report an issue](https://github.com/wispdevon/strider/issues)

## Try it

Clone the repository and follow [Getting Started](#getting-started).
The app uses local SQLite storage and passkey authentication. Before public
hosting, configure your public WebAuthn origin, generate production secrets,
and protect or remove the seeded workspace. See [Deployment](#deployment).

## Features

- Board-based project management with Plan, Active, Review, and completed history flows.
- Drag-and-drop task ordering and stage movement.
- Project detail pages with subtasks, progress, renaming, deletion, and assignment.
- Multi-user assignment for tasks and subtasks, including virtual Codex and Claude assignees.
- Board ownership, member invites, friend requests, and join codes.
- Optional board passwords and passkey-backed user authentication.
- Hall of Fame view with completion leaders, podium rankings, milestone history, and assignee avatars.
- Export support for board owners.
- Local SQLite persistence with deployment hardening for public hosting.
- Light and dark themes with a custom editorial workspace design system.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4
- SQLite with `better-sqlite3`
- Framer Motion
- `@dnd-kit/core` and `@dnd-kit/sortable`
- SimpleWebAuthn

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wispdevon/strider.git
cd strider
npm install
```

Create environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

For local development, the defaults are usually enough. For production, generate a strong session secret:

```bash
node scripts/gen-env.js
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

By default, the app redirects to `/board/my-workspace`. The seeded workspace uses:

- Join code: `DEFAULT1`
- Author PIN: `123456`

Protect or remove the default workspace before exposing the app publicly.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start the Next.js dev server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run start    # Start the production server
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
npm run build:cloudflare    # Build the OpenNext Cloudflare bundle
npm run preview             # Build and preview with the Cloudflare Workers runtime
npm run deploy              # Build and deploy with the Cloudflare OpenNext adapter
npm run preview:cloudflare  # Build and preview with the Cloudflare Workers runtime
npm run deploy:cloudflare   # Build and deploy with the Cloudflare OpenNext adapter
npm run cf-typegen          # Generate Cloudflare environment binding types
```

## Environment

See [.env.example](.env.example) for the full set of supported variables.

Important variables:

- `SESSION_SECRET`: Required in production for secure sessions.
- `ADMIN_API_TOKEN`: Optional token for the avatar reset maintenance endpoint.
- `RP_ID`: WebAuthn relying party hostname.
- `RP_ORIGIN`: WebAuthn origin, including protocol.
- `HOSTNAME` and `PORT`: Server bind settings for `next start`.

WebAuthn passkeys require `RP_ID` and `RP_ORIGIN` to match the hostname users actually visit.

Core files:

- [components/BoardView.tsx](components/BoardView.tsx): Main Kanban board experience.
- [components/ProjectDetail.tsx](components/ProjectDetail.tsx): Task detail and subtask management.
- [components/HallOfFame.tsx](components/HallOfFame.tsx): Completed project history and rankings.
- [lib/db-core.ts](lib/db-core.ts): SQLite connection, schema, and migrations.
- [lib/projects.ts](lib/projects.ts): Project and subtask persistence.
- [lib/boards.ts](lib/boards.ts): Board, member, and invite persistence.

## Data

Strider stores application data in SQLite:

```text
data/strider.sqlite
```

Back this file up regularly in production. It contains boards, projects, users, board members, passkeys, invites, and task history.

## Deployment

Read [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) before hosting Strider publicly. The deployment guide covers:

- Required production secrets.
- Caddy reverse proxy setup.
- TLS and WebAuthn hostname requirements.
- API authorization hardening.
- Rate limiting.
- Default board safety.
- SQLite backups.

Production checklist:

```bash
node scripts/gen-env.js
npm run build
npm run start
```

Use the included [Caddyfile](Caddyfile) if you want Caddy to terminate TLS and proxy to Next.js.

Cloudflare Workers configuration is included through `@opennextjs/cloudflare`,
`wrangler.jsonc`, and `open-next.config.ts`. Cloudflare CI/CD should use Node 22+
and `npm run deploy`. The current app still uses native
`better-sqlite3`; migrate persistence to Cloudflare D1 or another Workers-safe
database before relying on the Cloudflare deployment for production writes.

## Design

The visual direction is documented in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md). Strider uses a calm paper-like workspace aesthetic, restrained titanium accents, soft surfaces, and a custom Hall of Fame treatment for completed work.

## Development Notes

- This app uses Next.js 16. APIs and conventions may differ from older Next.js versions.
- Keep board/project authorization paths aligned with `lib/board-access.ts`.
- Keep `assigneeId` compatibility when changing assignment code; newer multi-assignment behavior uses `assigneeIds`.
- Do not commit `.env`, `.env.local`, or the SQLite database.

## Privacy

Strider does not collect data beyond what is necessary to run boards, accounts, assignments, invites, passkeys, sessions, security, and service operations. See the in-app Privacy Policy at `/privacy` for the full policy.

Production operators should protect the SQLite database, session secret, deployment environment, backups, and logs because they contain application data needed for the service to function.
