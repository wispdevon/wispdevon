Dust is a command line utility that provides a more efficient, graphical and intuitive version of the classic 'du' command. Instead of getting a long list of directories and files with their sizes, Dust presents the data in a more digestible tree format. This visually represents which directories are taking up the most space in your system, helping you clear up space more effectively.

Written in Rust, Dust is extremely fast and efficient. It supports features such as ignoring certain directories or files, displaying only the largest directories or files, and more. It follows the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well - in the case of Dust, that thing is providing an intuitive view of disk usage.
