### Hoffman's 1 cup pour-over

### Hoffman's Ultimate recipe
### Tetsu Kasuya's 4:6 Brew
A versatile and fun pour-over method that you could probably do on mountain tops.

**Dosage**: true 15:1, 225g with 15g
achieved from:
- 15g 
	x 3 (45g) 
	x 5 (225g)

**Philosophy**: the first 40% adjusts the sweetness and acidity, the 60% adjusts the coffee strength.

##### Standard pour:

| 0:00 | 0:45 | 1:30 | 2:15 | 3:00 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 45   | 45   | 45   | 45   | 45   |

A standard pour is 45g spaced out every 45 seconds
_**But the Tetsu method is more adjustable than that***_
##### Exhibit 1: For more sweetness
The difference here is adjusting the 40% to lean towards the _second_ pour.

| 0:00 | 0:45 | 1:30 | 2:15 | 3:00 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 30   | 60   | 45   | 45   | 45   |

##### Exhibit 2: For more acidity 
The difference here is adjusting the 40% to lean towards the _first_ pour

| 0:00 | 0:45 | 1:30 | 2:15 | 3:00 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 60   | 30   | 45   | 45   | 45   |

##### Exhibit 3: If coffee is too strong, squash the pours on the 60%

| 0:00 | 0:45 | 1:30 | 2:15 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 60   | 30   | 67.5 | 67.5 |
##### Exhibit 4: If coffee is too weak, expand the pours on the 60%
| 0:00 | 0:45 | 1:30  | 2:15  | 3:00  | 3:45  |
| ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 60   | 30   | 33.75 | 33.75 | 33.75 | 33.75 |
### Tetsu Kasuya's Lazy brew
This method produces 250g of coffee from a **single pour**, perfect for making coffee while maintaining forced social interactions.

**Dosage**: 10:1, 250g with 25g
**Philosophy**: When you've got too much coffee and too little time but don't have any other method of brewing.
