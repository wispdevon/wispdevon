A little hint of salt, a refreshing Lemonade that benefits from the taurine for that little bit of kick while still remaining palatable to those who don't consume major amounts of practically liquid cocaine. My friend said it's not the best lemonade he's ever had, but overall it serves it's purpose.. or at least it's purpose to me: fuel for late-night crunches without throwing up.

The can features a pretty cool exterior that caught my eye, with a pretty cool setting of clownfishes and multi-colored octopuses, definitely a whole thing.
